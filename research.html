            <h1>Professional Interests</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My background is in meteorology and physical oceanography, in particular numerical modelling of the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
<p>I did my undergraduate studies in Meteorology and Oceanography at the University of East Anglia, within the School of Environmental Sciences, with one year spent at the University of Miami, where I studied in the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, the College of Engineering and the Department of Mathematics.
After my BSc I completed a PhD in the School of Mathematics and the University of East Anglia, studying coupled ocean-atmopshere interactions in global climate models.</p>
<p>Following my PhD I spent 3 years working as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, working on a project that used high resolution atmospheric NWP models as climate models to understand the impact of processes that are too small to represent in typical climate models on large scale weather and climate variability.</p>
<p>I now work in industry for a metocean consultancy, where I develop and deploy numerical models used for operational weather forecasting and consultancy purposes.</p>

<h2>Scientific Computing</h2>
<p>I have a great interest in scientific computing, which has been a constant theme of my research and professional career.
I am interested in high performance computing for numerical modelling applications, and the tools and technologies that enable science to be done in ever more efficient and useful ways.</p>
<p>I'm alo interested in the development of open source data analysis tools for scientists.
Having freely available software written for non-proprietary programming languages enables a greater degree of sharing and collaboration in the scientific community and boosts the integrity of the science by encouraging reproducibility.
I've written a lot of software for analysis of both climate model output and observational data, and a lot of the core software I have created has been open-sourced in the hope that it
it will benefit the community.
I'm also involved in the development of <a href="http://scitools.org.uk/iris">Iris</a> and <a href="http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy">Cartopy</a> which are open source projects that ultimately make it easier to write correct meteorological and oceanographic data analysis programs in Python.
I contribute to other open source projects when I can.</p>
